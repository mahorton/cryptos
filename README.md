Crypto stuff for use on bittrex

To set up: just clone the repository, enter your API key and secret key into `api_key.json`, and have at it. 
Make sure you have the python wrapper for Bittrex API installed (pip install python-bittrex).

Obviously, use with caution. It is recommended you double check all the code for any functions/strategies you want to use.
